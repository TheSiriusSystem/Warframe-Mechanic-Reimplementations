Scripts are available in file form for people who don't want to use Roblox Studio, though there is no guarantee it'll be the same as in `place.rbxlx`.

These scripts are unfinished, but have been left in for transparency:
- `client/event_handler.luau`
- `modules/actor_ai.luau`
- `modules/projectile_base.luau`
